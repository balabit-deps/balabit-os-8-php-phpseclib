Starting with 2.0.15, we are merging the upstream tags as
upstream, instead of using the tarball that doesnâ€™t ship tests.

# Example to import upstream 2.0.19 version
version=2.0.19
# We still use the upstream branch to drop the .gitattributes file from upstream
gbp import-ref --upstream-tag=%\(version%~%-\)s -u$version --debian-branch=upstream
gbp import-ref --upstream-tree=BRANCH -u$version
